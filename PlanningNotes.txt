General
    Feature branching is likely not necessary for this project. The scope of the tasks is rather small and I dont have to worry about other devs working on it.
    I used curl commands for initial testing of feature 1. The output of said command is in output.json


Task 1
    //Reporting structure can be done fairly simply with recursion

    public static int calculateReporters(Employee person, int counter){
        int counter = 0;
        List<Employee> directReports = person.getDirectReports();

        if (directReports != null) {
            for (Employee report : directReports) {
                counter++; // count this direct report
                counter += calculateReporters(report); // count their reports
            }
        }

        return counter
    }

Task 2
    Not really any logic to pseudo code
